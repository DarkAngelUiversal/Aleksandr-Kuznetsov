I am a beginner DevOps specialist and have been actively developing my skills in this field for about a year. My goal is to make DevOps the main area of my professional activity. I am particularly attracted to solving complex problems and seeking innovative solutions. I strive not only to deepen my knowledge in this area but also to become a high-class specialist in the field of DevOps. I began my journey while still working in technical support for users of the 1C-Reporting service, where I wrote a Telegram bot for incident recording for work purposes, which then led me to explore programming in Python more deeply.

## My hobbies 
I am passionate about games, especially RTS strategies and MOBAs, the Warhammer 40K universe, and reading manhwa and novels. 

## Games:

My journey into the world of games began in 2008 with very simple games, which gradually led me to RTS strategies. I spent many days playing games like Stellaris, the Dawn of War series from the Warhammer 40K universe, Dota 2, Mount and Blade: Warband and Bannerlord, Starcraft 2, and others. Recently, I have been devoting less time to games as I am focused on my professional development. 

## Warhammer 40K: 

It all started with the game Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War – Soulstorm. After that, I became interested in this universe, which led me to read my first non-school book — "Horus Heresy Book I: Horus Rising." This plunged me deeper into the universe through books and YouTube videos, sparking my interest in reading.

## Manhwa/novels: 

It all began when I was watching anime and read a comment: "First you watch anime, then you read manga, then novels, and next thing you know, you’re writing fanfiction." Although I do not possess a talent for writing, I read one manhwa, then another, and after the 400th, I started reading novels. Among my favorites are "Shadow Slave," "Warlock of the Magus World," "Nanomancer Reborn – I've Become A Snow Girl?", and "Реинкарнация сестер: Путь войн и спокойствия".
